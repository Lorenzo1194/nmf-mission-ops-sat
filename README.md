# NanoSat MO Framework - mission tailoring for OPS-SAT
This repository contains parts of the NanoSat MO Framework specific to the OPS-SAT mission.

The content of this repository is mostly relevant for a deployment on a representative hardware (MityArm, OPS-SAT FlatSat and OPS-SAT flight model) and serves mostly as a reference.

During the development it is recommended to use the NMF SDK (released as a source in the main NMF repository on [GitHub]).
The SDK is based on a simulator, providing most of the platform functionalities accessible to the experimenter. Simulator allows running NMF applications without an access to a real satellite hardware.

The official website of the NanoSat MO Framework is available [here].
